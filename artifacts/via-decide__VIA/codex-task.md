You are working in repository via-decide/VIA on branch main.

MISSION
Push the Phase 0 initialized monorepo structure to the GitHub repository. 1. Initialize a git repository in viadecide-monorepo/. 2. Add the remote origin https://github.com/via-decide/VIA.git. 3. Commit the Phase 0 skeleton (shell, tools/*, services, shared, configs). 4. Push the main branch.

CONSTRAINTS
Direct push to main is allowed for this initialization. Do NOT include node_modules.

PROCESS (MANDATORY)
1. Read README.md and AGENTS.md before editing.
2. Audit architecture before coding. Summarize current behavior.
3. Preserve unrelated working code. Prefer additive modular changes.
4. Implement the smallest safe change set for the stated goal.
5. Run validation commands and fix discovered issues.
6. Self-review for regressions, missing env wiring, and docs drift.
7. Return complete final file contents for every modified or created file.

- AGENTS snippet:
# AGENTS — via-decide/VIA Rules for ALL coding agents (Codex, Claude, automated PRs) working in this repository. --- ## 1. Preservation Policy 1. Never delete tool folders under `tools/`. 2. Never remove working code — upgrades are additive only. 3. Never replace a functioning file with a placeh


SOP: PRE-MODIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
1. Adherence to Instructions: No deviations without explicit user approval.
2. Mandatory Clarification: Immediately ask if instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.
3. Proposal First: Always propose optimizations or fixes before implementing them.
4. Scope Discipline: Do not add unrequested features or modify unrelated code.
5. Vulnerability Check: Immediately flag and explain security risks.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Include: implementation summary, checks run, risks, rollback notes.
- Generate branch + PR package.
- Keep prompts deterministic and preservation-first.
