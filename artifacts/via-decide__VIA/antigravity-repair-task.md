TARGET
Validate and repair only the files touched by the previous implementation.

TASK
Backend Integration for Mars Module. 1. Set up a reverse-proxy (Nginx/Envoy) route from 'viadecide.com/mars' to the internal IP of the Mars micro-service. 2.

RULES
1. Audit touched files first and identify regressions.
2. Preserve architecture and naming conventions.

4. Re-run checks and provide concise root-cause notes.
5. Return complete contents for changed files only.

1. Strict Fix Only: Do not use repair mode to expand scope or add features.
2. Regression Check: Audit why previous attempt failed before proposing a fix.
3. Minimal Footprint: Only return contents for the actual repaired files.
