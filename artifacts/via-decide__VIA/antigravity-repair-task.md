Repair mode for repository via-decide/VIA.

TARGET
Validate and repair only the files touched by the previous implementation.

TASK
Implement Secure Admin Authentication. 1. Create the '/api/auth/verify-admin' endpoint. 2. Modify the VIA authentication middleware to check for a 'role: sovereign' flag on the user profile linked to your specific Google ID. 3. Generate a long-lived 'Ops-Token' to secure the websocket data stream.

RULES
1. Audit touched files first and identify regressions.
2. Preserve architecture and naming conventions.
3. Make minimal repairs only; do not expand scope.
4. Re-run checks and provide concise root-cause notes.
5. Return complete contents for changed files only.

SOP: REPAIR PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
1. Strict Fix Only: Do not use repair mode to expand scope or add features.
2. Regression Check: Audit why previous attempt failed before proposing a fix.
3. Minimal Footprint: Only return contents for the actual repaired files.
